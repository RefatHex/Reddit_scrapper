# Reddit Python API Project

This project utilizes the Reddit API to fetch information from the subreddit "python". It retrieves the top 10 posts and the newest 10 posts from the subreddit along with some details such as the post ID, author, image URL, score, and comment count. Additionally, it prints the body and author of the first two comments for each post.
